## Write up by dtechshield

Based on the instructions presented we made a tcp connection to `recent-puzzle.satellitesabove.me` on port `5015` 

```
nc recent-puzzle.satellitesabove.me 5015
```

This presented us with the following output:

```

First we logged in went to the http server:  `http://18.222.149.133:7834/`

Took a look at the page source: 
![Alt text](images/00_fprime_id.PNG "a title")

Identified that the system was using NASA's F Prime - https://github.com/nasa/fprime

Command interface was somewhat familiar from previous hackasat events...

Quickly looking at the interface we noticed the `Commanding` tab - started examining the available commands...

![Commands of Interest](images/01_commands_of_interest_highlighted.PNG "commands of interest")


We noticed `fileManager.ShellCommand`

Assuming this was a Unix based system first issued a command to see what is in the current directory:

```
2021-06-27T05:18:31.854Z    0x25d    fileManager.ShellCommand    [ "ls", "test.log" ]
2021-06-27T05:18:57.059Z    0x1f5    fileDownlink.SendFile    [ "test.log", "test.log" ]
```

Looking at the test.log we saw that there was a `satellite.exe`

```
$ cat test.log 

satellite.exe

test.log
```


Downloaded the `satellite.exe` using the `fileDownlink.SendFile` command.


Loaded `satellite.exe` into Ghidra and began our analysis:

```
void FUN_0014f610(long param_1)

{
  char *__s;
  
  FUN_00150820();
  *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0x3b0) = 0;
  __s = getenv("SAT_FLAG");
  strlen(__s);
  std::__cxx11::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>::_M_replace
            (param_1 + 0x3b8U,0,*(char **)(param_1 + 0x3c0),(ulong)__s);
  std::__cxx11::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>::resize
            (param_1 + 0x3b8U,-0x60);
  setenv("SAT_FLAG","ThisIsNotTheFlagYouAreLookingFor",1);
  return;
}

```

Noticed the `SAT_FLAG` environment variable...

Ran echo $SAT_FLAG on the web interface

Downloading the file the team saw

```
 cat flag.txt 
ThisIsNotTheFlagYouAreLookingFor
```

supersat executed  the following commands:

```
2021-06-27T05:33:32.386Z    0x25d    fileManager.ShellCommand    [ "grep -ra flag /proc/*", "grep.log" ]
2021-06-27T05:33:42.489Z    0x1f5    fileDownlink.SendFile    [ "grep.log", "grep.log" ]
```

The initial response received for `SAT_FLAG` environment variable almost send us on our way, but dumping the full set of environment variables the team captured the flag.
